## Component Updates

- âœ… `ShiftForm` - Updated to use App Router and ShadCN components

## Next Steps

1. **Router References Update**
   - Continue updating components to use `next/navigation` instead of `next/router`
   - Key components to update:
     - VolunteerList.jsx
     - ApplicationForm.jsx
     - LogHoursForm.jsx
     - AuthContext.jsx

2. **Verification and Testing**
   - Thoroughly test all migrated pages to ensure proper functionality
   - Focus on state management, form submissions, and navigation

3. **Cleanup**
   - Delete old Pages Router pages after verifying that App Router pages work correctly:
     - src/pages/admin/volunteers.jsx
     - src/pages/shifts/index.jsx
     - src/pages/shifts/new.jsx
     - src/pages/register.tsx
     - src/pages/volunteers/[id].jsx
   - Remove any unused components or utility functions

## Implementation Notes

- All new pages use the ShadcnLayout component for consistent styling
- Loading states use Skeleton components for better user experience
- Form validation and submission logic has been preserved
- Authentication checks remain consistent with the original implementation

## Remaining Issues

- Ensure all `next/router` imports are updated to `next/navigation`
- Verify that authentication and redirects work properly in the new structure
- Check for proper handling of query parameters and route parameters
- Update the authentication context to handle App Router navigation
