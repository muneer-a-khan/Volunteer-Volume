## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Complete migration of admin pages
   - Implement security enhancements
   - Add unit tests for critical components

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Complete TypeScript conversion
   - Implement performance optimizations
   - Add integration tests

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Complete accessibility improvements
   - Finalize documentation
   - Add comprehensive end-to-end tests

## Production Deployment Plan

1. **Pre-deployment Tasks**
   - Complete all high priority items
   - Run performance audit
   - Run security audit
   - Complete test coverage of critical paths

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Use the deployment script for consistent deployments
   - Follow the staging -> production workflow
   - Implement blue/green deployment to minimize downtime

3. **Post-deployment Tasks**
   - Monitor application performance
   - Monitor error rates
   - Collect user feedback
   - Plan incremental improvements

## Environment-specific Configuration

For each environment (development, staging, production), ensure the following are properly configured:

- Database connections
- Authentication services
- API endpoints
- Feature flags
- Logging levels
- Analytics

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

Once in production, establish a routine for:

- Dependency updates (monthly)
- Security patches (as soon as available)
- Performance monitoring (weekly)
- Database backups (daily)
- Log rotation (configured automatically)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration of admin pages to App Router
2. Implement the security enhancements
3. Add unit tests for critical components
4. Complete the TypeScript conversion of remaining components
5. Run a comprehensive security and performance audit
