## Collaboration Guidelines

### Branching Strategy
- Each issue should have its own branch.
- If you are the first to assign yourself to an issue, create a branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/issue-<issue_number>
  ```
- Keep branch names structured, e.g., `voice-processing/multiple-speakers`, `UI/rendering-error`.
- Avoid making structural changes unless necessary and communicate before making them.

### Commit & Merge Guidelines
#### Commit Messages
Use meaningful commit messages following this format:
```
[Label name] Short description
```
Example:
```
[voice-processing] Implemented AI-driven scenario-based questioning
```

#### Merging
When a feature is complete:

1. Ensure your branch is up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout feature/issue-<issue_number>
   git rebase main
   ```

2. Create a pull request (PR) with a detailed description.

#### Creating a Pull Request
1. Push your updated feature branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/issue-<issue_number>
   ```

2. On GitHub:
   - Navigate to this repository
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Fill out the PR form:
     - Base branch: `main`
     - Compare branch: `feature/issue-<issue_number>`
     - Title: Brief description of the change
     - Description: Add details about the change and relevant issue number
     - Assign appropriate reviewers
     - Add appropriate labels

3. Wait for review and address any feedback by pushing new commits.

4. Once approved, use "Squash and merge" and delete the feature branch.
